# Changelog

## 0.3.0 - 2026-04-27

### Features

- Verifies the Sigstore build-provenance attestation of the downloaded binary during `npm install @zantarix/cursus`, confirming it was produced by the official release workflow before writing it to disk. [c453746]

## 0.2.3 - 2026-04-27

### Bug Fixes

- Fixes Windows release binaries, which were failing to build due to a linker incompatibility in the cross-compilation toolchain. Windows binaries are now built natively using the MSVC toolchain with a statically linked CRT, producing self-contained executables with no runtime DLL dependencies. [6de8fe6]

## 0.2.2 - 2026-04-25

### Bug Fixes

- update rust crate octocrab to v0.49.8 [c458adb] via #95

## 0.2.1 - 2026-04-19

### Bug Fixes

- Fix a packaging issue with the OSX artifacts [e6b796a]

## 0.2.0 - 2026-04-19

### Features

- Output from the configured build command and npm lock command is now streamed live to the terminal as the command runs, rather than buffered until completion. Long-running builds no longer appear to hang with no output. [ac67ec6]

## 0.1.1 - 2026-04-19

### Bug Fixes

- Logs the filename of the created changeset after running `cursus change`. [9ce35b8]
- Fixes npm package binary download failing due to incorrect release tag format. [ad7ef84]

## 0.1.0 - 2026-04-19

### Bug Fixes

- update rust crate clap to v4.6.1 [f278f15] via #83
- update rust crate tokio to v1.52.1 [59bb964] via #85
- update rust crate tokio to v1.51.0 [da46fa8] via #66
- update rust crate tokio to v1.51.1 [c76faf5] via #73
- fix: workspace-inherited Cargo versions now included in release commit [fcfcab9]

  When crates use `version.workspace = true`, the workspace root `Cargo.toml` was modified by `write_version` but never staged for git — causing the version bump to be absent from release PRs. `PackageManagerAdapter::write_version` now returns the list of modified paths (mirroring `update_dependency_version`), and callers extend `modified_files` accordingly.
- update rust crate octocrab to v0.49.7 [3beed54] via #62
